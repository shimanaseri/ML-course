# Mini Project 1 - Learning Objectives

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to a mini project aimed at improving understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques.

## What You'll Learn

### Question 1: Linear Classifier Model
1. **Generate and Visualize Dataset:** Using `sklearn.datasets`, generate a dataset with 1000 samples, 4 features, and 3 classes. Display the dataset and discuss why it might be challenging. Make it more challenging.

2. **Train a Classifier:** Use a linear classifier from `sklearn.linear_model` with appropriate hyperparameters. Explain your choice of hyperparameters and their impact on the results. Display the classification accuracy.

3. **Decision Boundaries:** Show the decision boundaries of your trained model along with the data points. Highlight misclassified samples.

4. **Repeat with Custom Data:** Use `drawdata` to create a new dataset with a different number of classes and features. Repeat the training and visualization process.

### Question 2: Fault Detection Dataset
1. **CWRU Bearing Dataset:** Familiarize yourself with the CWRU Bearing dataset by researching its use in fault diagnosis. Download normal and fault data from the specified links.

2. **Create a Feature Matrix:** From the dataset, create a feature matrix with at least 200 samples per class and a window length of 100. Extract features for each class.

3. **Feature Extraction:** Discuss the importance of feature extraction in machine learning. Extract at least 8 features from the dataset using the methods listed in Table 1.

4. **Data Shuffling and Normalization:** Explain the importance of data shuffling and split the data into training and testing sets. Normalize the data using at least two methods and explain the process.

5. **Evaluate a Model:** Without using pre-built functions, implement an algorithm to classify the data. Plot the loss function and analyze the performance.

6. **Scikit-Learn Evaluation:** Train and evaluate a linear classifier using `sklearn.linear_model`. Compare the results and plot the loss function if available.

7. **Optional Challenge:** Use Orange data mining software to implement the process. Provide a video or visual demonstration of your work.

### Question 3: Weather Data Analysis
1. **Weather Dataset Analysis:** Analyze the 'Weather in Szeged 2006-2016' dataset. Study the relationship between Humidity and Temperature, and Apparent Temperature and Humidity.

2. **Histograms and Heatmaps:** Plot histograms and heatmaps to visualize the data distribution and correlations.

3. **Model Training and Comparison:** Train models using LS and RLS, adjusting parameters appropriately. Compare the results with suitable plots.

4. **Weighted Least Squares:** Apply and explain Weighted Least Squares on the dataset.

5. **Optional Challenge:** Research and implement the QR-Decomposition-Based RLS algorithm. Provide an analysis.
